# Topical App

Social Media application inspired by Twitter using Vue.js, Py4Web, and Bulma CSS.
The app allows users to create posts in a common feed (all posts, by all users, end up in the same feed). 

## Tags

All words preceded with a '#' are added to tags. If all posts containing a tag T are deleted, the tag is removed from the list.

## Deployment 

To run py4web, you can do: 

    py4web run --errorlog=:stdout -L 20 apps
